        description: 'A couple of months ago WAG became aware of a lawsuit that Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was bringing against a group of people who had been standing outside and harassing the clients of Choices Womens Medical Center. We sent a letter to thank @agschneiderman, but felt strongly that we also needed to support the staff of Choices for their daily commitment to reproductive healthcare. WAG members visited @choiceswomensmedical this week to deliver those gifts (a Keurig, water cooler, and microwave) for the staff. We were treated to a tour of their fantastic facilities by Administrator Kelly Mallinson and got to meet and chat with the founder and CEO, Merle Hoffman. Merle is a true warrior and has been fighting for women''s reproductive healthcare for over 40 years! It was an honor to meet both of these inspiring women and their amazing staff. Looking forward to a long and productive relationship with these women and their extraordinary facility! Thank you Choices'
